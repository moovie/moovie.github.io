00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:10,180
Are you Jake Sully?

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,220
I'd like to talk to you about a fresh start, on a new world.

3
00:00:16,915 --> 00:00:18,280
You'd be making a difference.

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,800
I became a marine for the hardship.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,580
I told myself I could pass
any test a man can pass.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,600
All I ever wanted was a single thing worth fighting for.

7
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:32,543
Ladies and gentlemen...

8
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:37,243
you are not in Kansas any more.

9
00:00:38,043 --> 00:00:39,506
You are on Pandora.

10
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:41,855
You should see your faces.

11
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,307
We have an indigenous population called the Na'vi.

12
00:00:46,022 --> 00:00:47,685
They are very hard to kill.

13
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:49,599
This is why we're here.

14
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:52,990
Because this little grey rock sells for twenty million a kilo.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,680
Their village happens to be resting on the richest deposit,

16
00:00:56,755 --> 00:00:57,780
and they need to relocate.

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,124
Those savages are threatening our whole operation.

18
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:05,800
We're on the brink of war and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution.

19
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:12,000
The concept is to drive these remotely controlled bodies, called avatars.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,488
They're grown from human DNA... Mixed with DNA of the natives.

21
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:19,664
A marine, in an avatar body.

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,350
That's a potent mix.

23
00:01:21,892 --> 00:01:24,971
You get me what I need, I'll see to it you get your legs back...

24
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,720
Your real legs.

25
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:27,546
Hell yeah, Sir.

26
00:01:27,843 --> 00:01:28,847
Looks like you.

27
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:30,839
This is your avatar.

28
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:33,822
Just relax and let your mind go blank.

29
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:36,481
That shouldn't be hard for you.

30
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:52,126
Jake, it's real simple...

31
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:57,791
I want you to learn from the inside, I want you to gain their trust.

32
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:03,278
You should not be here.

33
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:05,519
Go back!

34
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,079
All this is your fault.

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,579
I need your help.

36
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,422
Outstanding.

37
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:26,837
Haven't gotten lost in the woods, have you?

38
00:02:27,532 --> 00:02:29,291
Did you forget what team you're playing for?

39
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:32,160
The strong prey on the weak...

40
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,722
And nobody does a thing.

41
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,179
You've got one hour.

42
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:37,188
You knew this would happen?

43
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:38,522
Everything changed.

44
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:40,800
Jake, it's crazy here.

45
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:43,594
Quaritch is rolling and there's no stopping him.

46
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:47,384
We're going up against gunships with bows and arrows.

47
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:48,999
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

48
00:03:04,487 --> 00:03:05,666
They've sent us a message...

49
00:03:06,164 --> 00:03:07,943
That they can take whatever they want.

50
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:10,437
Well we will send them a message...

51
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,617
That this...

52
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,317
This is our land!
